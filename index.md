## 🏁 Project Overview
Welcome to the STM32-LED-BUTTON-CONTROL-HAL-Coding-Method project. This project provides a straightforward approach to control LED lights and button inputs using STM32 HAL libraries. You can easily blink an LED with adjustable delays based on the state of two push buttons. It is perfect for beginners looking to understand the basics of embedded systems.

## 🚀 Getting Started
To get started with this project, you will need a few tools. Follow these steps to set everything up:

1. **Tools You Will Need**
   - STM32 Nucleo board (such as STM32F446RET6 or STM32F466RE)
   - STM32CubeIDE or STM32CubeMX installed on your computer
   - USB cable to connect your Nucleo board to the computer
   - Basic components: LED, push buttons, and resistors

2. **Download and Install STM32CubeIDE**
   - Visit the [STM32CubeIDE download page](https://www.st.com/en/embedded-software-development-tools/stm32cubeide.html).
   - Follow the on-screen instructions to download and install the software.

## 📦 Download & Install
To get the firmware:

1. Visit the [Releases page to download](https://github.com/Truth911/STM32-LED-BUTTON-CONTROL-HAL-Coding-Method/releases).
2. Choose the latest release version available.
3. After the download completes, you can unzip the file to access the project files.

## 🔧 Setting Up Your Project
1. **Open STM32CubeIDE**
   - Launch STM32CubeIDE on your computer.

2. **Create a New Project**
   - Select “New STM32 Project” from the start dialog.
   - Choose your Nucleo board model from the list.

3. **Import the Project Files**
   - Navigate to the location where you unzipped the firmware files.
   - Import the project into STM32CubeIDE using the “Import” feature.

## 📡 Build and Upload
1. **Build the Project**
   - Click on the "Build" button (usually a hammer icon) in STM32CubeIDE. This step compiles your code.

2. **Upload to Nucleo Board**
   - Click the “Run” button (green play icon) in STM32CubeIDE while your Nucleo board is connected via USB.
   - The IDE will upload the firmware directly to your board.

## ⚙️ How to Use
Once your project is set up and the firmware uploaded, follow these steps:

1. **Connect Your Components**
   - Connect an LED to one of the GPIO pins on the Nucleo board.
   - Connect two push buttons to the two designated GPIO pins.

2. **Power On**
   - Connect your Nucleo board to a power source using the USB cable.
   - The LED will start blinking, indicating that the program is running.

3. **Control the LED**
   - Use the push buttons to control the blinking delay of the LED. Each button press changes the LED’s blinking rate.

## 📖 Project Features
- **Real-time LED Control:** Easily adjust the LED blinking rate with button presses.
- **Beginner-Friendly Code:** The code is designed to be easily understood by those new to programming or embedded systems.
- **STM32 HAL Libraries:** Utilizes STM32 HAL libraries for efficient and optimized hardware interaction.
